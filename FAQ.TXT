# What can CardboardSDK do for me?

CardboardSDK excels at capturing the relevant device input for using a Google Cardboard. It gives you a wide range of events and data which are important given the constrained input options.

Simply put, CardboardSDK enables you to create cool VR games for a wide audience.



# How do I use CardboardSDK in my existing project?

Copy over these directories:
- Plugins
- Dive
- CardboardSDK

Then replace your current main camera with the Dive/Dive_Camera prefab. Be sure to also set the default orientation to Landscape Left in the Player Settings.

Check out ExampleCharacterController.cs for examples on using CardboardInput with your existing scenes.



# Can I release my own game using CardboardSDK?

Yes. Read CONTRIBUTORS.TXT first as it contains an overview of the licenses for the libraries used. Dive in particular has an interesting requirement.
